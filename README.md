*Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree - Term 2, Project 2*

### **Project Overview**

This project contains the results from Project 1 of Term 2 in the Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree. The goal of this project is to create an Unscented Kalman Filter that fuses Lidar and Radar measurements.

For testing, the project uses the Term 2 Simulator, which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).

To help in installing dependencies, choose the install script appropriate for your system ([Mac](./install-mac.sh) or [Ubuntu Linux](./install-ubuntu.sh)). Once the installation of dependencies is complete, the main program can be built and run by doing the following from the project's top level directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./UnscentedKF

** Note: in the dependencies listed in CMakeLists.txt, the path to your libuv may vary. If that's the case, you will need to update this path in CMakeLists.txt **
